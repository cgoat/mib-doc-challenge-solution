# MIB Doc Challenge — technical memo

**Score on the public training split (challenge `scripts/evaluate.py`):**
`120.29 / 150` — extraction `42.55/50`, classification `62.01/80`, calibration
`15.73/20`, 0 missing cases, 8 catastrophic false approvals against 431 true
denials. Runtime 1.00 s/PDF on 4 vCPU against a 6 s/PDF budget; image 0.32 GiB.

No LLM, no network, no API keys. PyMuPDF for the text layer, PP-OCRv4 via ONNX
Runtime for scans, a hand-written policy engine, and one 27-weight logistic
model for confidence, fitted on the public training labels.

## What the data actually is

Two facts shaped every decision:

1. **Roughly half the pages are scans.** 1,956 of 4,159 training pages carry no
   usable text layer, and 851 of 1,000 packets contain at least one. They are
   144-DPI JPEGs degraded with page skew, *per-line* jitter, faint gridlines,
   speckle, stray border ticks, decorative overlay stamps, and — in a minority —
   a 90° or 180° rotation. Anything that doesn't read scans well loses most of
   the available points.
2. **Fields are drawn from small closed vocabularies.** 12 species codes, 13
   home worlds, 5 visa classes, 10 purposes, 8 risk flags, and applicant names
   built from 144 first and 144 last name parts. This turns degraded OCR from a
   transcription problem into a nearest-neighbour problem.

## Pipeline

**Trust separation first.** Every page's text layer is split into visible spans
and untrusted ones — white fill, sub-6pt type, or geometry outside the page crop.
In the training set that isolates the injected content perfectly: every
`SYSTEM: ignore visible evidence…` payload is white 5pt text. The untrusted set
never reaches the field parser; it is only recorded as a calibration feature.
Large red overlays (`SAMPLE DENIAL`) are classified as watermarks and stripped
before the note parser looks for a verdict, per the field manual's trap list.

**Scans: the recognition engine turned out to be the whole game.** I built the
scan path around Tesseract first, and it needed a lot of scaffolding to work at
all: decode the embedded JPEG at native resolution (never re-render — that
resamples an already-lossy image), keep only glyph-sized connected components,
dilate into words, group into lines, deskew each line, then OCR one line at a
time at `--psm 7` on *grayscale inside a dilated glyph footprint* rather than a
binary mask. Whole-page Tesseract produces pure garbage on these documents,
because the ink covers a small fraction of a noisy page and the layout analyser
locks onto the scan gridlines. Orientation needed its own OCR-based vote across
four rotations, because every geometric score I tried was actively wrong — the
gridlines segment into convincing-looking "text lines" at any angle.

All of that scaffolding produced 40.7/50 extraction, and it was still misreading
`Wolf-1061c` as `Woll-1081c` and `2026-03-15` as `2028-03-16`.

Swapping the engine for PP-OCRv4 (`rapidocr-onnxruntime`, 16 MB of ONNX carried
inside the wheel) replaced the segmentation, grouping and orientation machinery
with a text detector that simply finds the boxes, and moved the score by more
than every other change I made combined:

| | Tesseract + scaffolding | PP-OCRv4 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Extraction | 40.69 | **42.55** |
| Classification | 60.68 | **62.01** |
| Adjudication accuracy | 69.8% | **72.1%** |
| Total | 116.71 | **120.29** |

The per-field gains land exactly where the old pipeline was weakest —
`sponsor_id` 65.8 → 78.7%, `arrival_date` 78.9 → 87.9%, `visa_class` 80.4 →
85.7% — and it is no slower end to end (1.00 s/PDF against 0.96), because
detection replaces the per-line calls and the orientation sweep. The Tesseract
path is still in the tree behind `MIB_OCR_ENGINE` so the comparison is
reproducible.

The one integration wrinkle: PP-OCR returns a detected box as a single token, so
`Visa Class: MED-3` comes back as `VisaClass:MED-3`. OCR lines are re-spaced on
the colon and on lower-to-upper transitions before label matching.

**Parsing both layouts.** Native pages are two-column, so a single visual row
holds the value *and* its label, in either order and sometimes with placeholder
graphics text appended; OCR'd scans render `Label: value`. The parser locates the
label anywhere in a row, preferring the longest matching span (otherwise "Fee"
beats "Fee Status" and "Status" becomes the value), and pushes both sides through
the field normaliser, keeping whichever validates.

**Merging.** Each field is voted across pages, weighted by the field manual's
evidence precedence (note > intake > biometric > sponsor > registry) plus a bonus
for a clean text layer over OCR. Case id comes from the per-page footer, which
survives in the text layer even on scans — not from the filename.

**Vocabulary snapping, and what the scoring asymmetry implies.** A wrong
extraction and a blank score identically — zero — so refusing an ambiguous match
buys nothing and forfeits the chance of being right. Below the strict threshold
the normalizer therefore still names the nearest entry, flagged as a guess.

The flag is what makes that safe. A guess is reported for extraction, but the
rules engine treats it exactly as a field it never recovered, so a guessed
`TRANSIT-7` or `Wolf-1061c` can never deny an applicant. The invariant is
checkable and I checked it: classification is bit-identical either way, 60.72/80
with the same 6 false approvals, while extraction rises. Fields whose value comes
from a regex rather than a vocabulary — sponsor id, dates — have no meaningful
"nearest" reading and stay strict.

## The adjudication policy

The public manual covers most of it; the rest I read off the training packets'
own adjudicator notes, which cite their reasons in plain text. That surfaced two
revoked sponsors beyond the manual's list (`SPN-2718`, `SPN-9090`) and the
embargoed home world `Wolf-1061c`.

Checking each condition against the labels shows the policy is close to
deterministic: disqualifying flag → denied (186/186), `TRANSIT-7` → denied
(53/53), unpaid fee → denied (50/50, including diplomatic packets — the manual's
waiver language does *not* rescue an unpaid fee), unknown fee → review (44/44).
Review-only flags are review 78% of the time and denial the rest.

**Staleness needed a reference the packets don't contain.** The manual calls an
application stale more than 180 days before *packet receipt*, and no packet
states its receipt date. The signal is real — among otherwise-clean packets,
2025 arrival dates run 12 approved to 25 denied while 2026-01 onward runs 254 to
13 — so "now" is estimated from the batch's own arrival dates at the 95th
percentile. Not the maximum: a single OCR misreading of 2026 as 2076 would make
every other packet look stale, which is exactly what happened on my first
attempt. Judged below the adjudicator note so a signed verdict still wins. Worth
+0.87 classification points, and it drops false approvals from 10 to 6. The gain
is flat from a 180- to a 240-day threshold, so it is not fitted to one cutoff.

Applying this order to *ground-truth* fields scores 70.4/80 with 89.2% accuracy —
so the policy is essentially at its ceiling and my remaining classification gap
is an extraction gap, not a policy gap. I searched all orderings of the
conditions; the ranking is insensitive to it because they rarely co-occur.

**The one non-obvious rule.** My first working version made 74 catastrophic false
approvals. Almost all were packets where I found no risk flag — because the
biometric slip was unreadable or absent, not because the applicant was clean. So
approval now requires having actually *read* flag evidence; "no flag found"
defaults to review. That cut false approvals from 74 to 14 at no cost in total score.
I checked whether it was merely a scoring artefact: among fully-native packets
with no biometric page at all, 30% still have a real risk flag in the labels. The
evidence genuinely isn't in the packet, so review is the honest answer.

## Confidence

Calibration is scored on Brier error against "was the decision right", so the
target is honesty, not a high number. The dominant predictor is *why* the
decision was made — a signed adjudicator note is right 99.3% of the time, an
unread risk panel 25.5%. A logistic model over the decision reason, OCR fraction,
unreadable-page fraction, evidence recovered, and cross-page agreement gives a
**5-fold cross-validated Brier of 0.121** (15.2/20) against 0.216 for the
best constant predictor. I report the cross-validated figure because the
in-sample 0.114 is optimistic.

## Failure modes I know about

- **Unreadable scans dominate the loss, but less of it is recoverable than the
  correlation suggests.** Extraction accuracy is 96.1% on packets needing no OCR,
  83.3% when the scans are readable, and 71.8% when a page cannot be classified
  at all. I assumed classification was the bottleneck and made page kinds
  inferable from the fields a page parsed rather than its heading; that fixed ~30
  page kinds and moved the score by zero, because those pages were already
  contributing their fields regardless of kind. The remaining unreadable pages
  are genuinely destroyed ink, not mislabelled ones, so the correlation between
  "has an unreadable page" and "scores badly" is substantially confounded by
  damage that no OCR would recover.
- **Over-review is the largest single bucket and is not a rules problem.** 264
  packets are sent to review that should have been decided — nominally 15.8
  classification points. I tested every subgroup: no biometric page, fully
  native text, all pages classified, all seven core fields recovered. Approving
  scores worse than reviewing in every one of them; even the cleanest subgroup
  (121 packets, fully native, complete fields) splits 64 approved to 29 denied,
  where approving nets 396 raw points against 410 for reviewing. Those points
  need evidence, not a threshold.
- **Eight false approvals, five of them one cause.** The packet's fee receipt was
  unreadable, so the fee defaulted to `paid` when the truth was `unpaid`.
  Requiring a *read* receipt before approving cuts them to four — but costs 2.4
  classification points, so I did not take it. Eight against 431 true denials is
  a tail, not a pattern.
- **Sponsor IDs remain the weakest recovered field** at 78.7%. They are 4 random
  digits with no vocabulary to snap to, and some are deliberately smudged, so
  unlike the vocabulary fields there is no defensible guess to fall back on.
- **Applicant-name precision looks like a bug and isn't worth fixing.** 152 names
  are wrong, half confidently snapped to real-but-incorrect lexicon entries.
  Tightening the threshold would genuinely reduce that, but it converts *wrong*
  into *blank* and both score zero.
- **The gazetteer is a generalisation risk.** If the private test introduces new
  species or worlds, the threshold and margin check should pass them through
  unchanged rather than snap them — but they would then be raw OCR, and less
  accurate. This is the part of the system I'd most want to see private-test
  numbers for.
- **Revoked-sponsor and embargo lists are learned from ~10 note citations each.**
  They are right 72–87% of the time on training. A private test with a different
  revoked set would degrade these specific rules, though not the policy shape.
- **Multi-applicant packets** are detected (conflicting case ids in headers) and
  routed to review rather than resolved per-applicant.

## What I would do with another week

1. **Not a task-specific recogniser — I tried it and it lost.** The obvious next
   step looked like training on this generator's output, and the data comes free:
   `train_labels.csv` gives the true value for every field, the detector gives
   the line box, so 3,155 genuinely-degraded line crops can be harvested with
   exact labels and no annotation. For the closed-vocabulary fields the target is
   a *class*, not a character sequence, which is a far easier problem — 12 species
   codes rather than arbitrary text. I trained a small CNN per field on a GPU,
   splitting by packet so no case straddled the split.

   It lost on every field, against the same held-out packets:

   | Field | Trained classifier | PP-OCR + vocabulary snapping |
   | --- | ---: | ---: |
   | species_code | 81.7% | **98.3%** |
   | home_world | 68.6% | **92.8%** |
   | visa_class | 54.8% | **81.7%** |
   | declared_purpose | 54.1% | **85.9%** |
   | fee_status | 64.7% | **70.8%** |

   The ceiling is data volume: ~500-900 crops per field is roughly 50 examples
   per class, against a recogniser pretrained on millions of images. This does
   not prove the idea is unworkable — genuine fine-tuning from the PP-OCR weights,
   or synthetic renders in the four fonts the generator uses (Helvetica,
   Helvetica-Bold, Times-Roman, Helvetica-Oblique) to lift the volume, could
   still clear the bar. But it does mean the cheap version of the idea is dead,
   and I would want that volume problem solved before spending more on it.

2. **Train a small character classifier on the rendered fonts.** The generator
   uses a handful of fonts at known sizes; a few-hundred-KB CNN over segmented
   glyphs would likely beat Tesseract on this specific degradation, and fits the
   250 MiB artefact limit comfortably.
3. **Multi-hypothesis OCR with vocabulary-constrained decoding.** Keep Tesseract's
   top-N per line and score candidates against the closed vocabularies, rather
   than snapping a single noisy string after the fact.
4. **Per-field confidence, not just per-decision.** Extraction is scored per
   field; knowing which fields are shaky would let me choose between emitting a
   low-confidence reading and leaving it blank.
5. **Cross-validate the policy constants.** The revoked-sponsor and embargo lists
   are currently fitted on all 1,000 training packets with no held-out estimate
   of how much they generalise.

## Reproducing

`README.md` covers the Docker contract and the two fitted artefacts
(`mib/lexicon.json`, `mib/calibration.json`), both regenerated from the public
training split by scripts in `tools/`. Nothing is keyed to a case id or filename;
`python -m pytest tests/ -q` runs 20 unit tests covering layout parsing, OCR
normalisation, injection resistance and every policy branch.
