# MIB Doc Challenge — technical memo

**Score on the public training split (challenge `scripts/evaluate.py`):**
`114.68 / 150` — extraction `40.19/50`, classification `59.17/80`, calibration
`15.32/20`, 0 missing cases, 14 catastrophic false approvals against 431 true
denials. Runtime ~1.0 s/PDF on 4 vCPU against a 6 s/PDF budget; image 0.23 GiB.

No LLM, no network, no API keys. PyMuPDF for the text layer, OpenCV + Tesseract
for scans, a hand-written policy engine, and one 26-weight logistic model for
confidence, fitted on the public training labels.

## What the data actually is

Two facts shaped every decision:

1. **Roughly half the pages are scans.** 1,956 of 4,159 training pages carry no
   usable text layer, and 851 of 1,000 packets contain at least one. They are
   144-DPI JPEGs degraded with page skew, *per-line* jitter, faint gridlines,
   speckle, stray border ticks, decorative overlay stamps, and — in a minority —
   a 90° or 180° rotation. Anything that doesn't read scans well loses most of
   the available points.
2. **Fields are drawn from small closed vocabularies.** 12 species codes, 13
   home worlds, 5 visa classes, 10 purposes, 8 risk flags, and applicant names
   built from 144 first and 144 last name parts. This turns degraded OCR from a
   transcription problem into a nearest-neighbour problem.

## Pipeline

**Trust separation first.** Every page's text layer is split into visible spans
and untrusted ones — white fill, sub-6pt type, or geometry outside the page crop.
In the training set that isolates the injected content perfectly: every
`SYSTEM: ignore visible evidence…` payload is white 5pt text. The untrusted set
never reaches the field parser; it is only recorded as a calibration feature.
Large red overlays (`SAMPLE DENIAL`) are classified as watermarks and stripped
before the note parser looks for a verdict, per the field manual's trap list.

**Scans, line at a time.** Whole-page OCR on these documents produces garbage —
the ink covers a small fraction of a noisy page, so the layout analyser locks
onto gridlines. Instead I decode the embedded JPEG at native resolution (never
re-render — that resamples an already-lossy image), keep only glyph-sized
connected components, dilate horizontally into words, discard isolated marks,
group words into lines, deskew each line independently, and OCR one line at a
time at `--psm 7`. Crucially the OCR input is *grayscale inside a dilated glyph
footprint*, not a binary mask: the footprint removes gridlines while the retained
antialiasing is worth several characters per line.

Orientation is decided by how much real form vocabulary each of the four
rotations yields. I first tried a cheap geometric score (are lines wide and
horizontal?) and it was actively wrong — the scanned gridlines segment into
convincing-looking text lines at any angle, and it flipped pages that had read
correctly. The upright reading short-circuits, so only doubtful pages pay for
the alternatives.

**Parsing both layouts.** Native pages are two-column, so a single visual row
holds the value *and* its label, in either order and sometimes with placeholder
graphics text appended; OCR'd scans render `Label: value`. The parser locates the
label anywhere in a row, preferring the longest matching span (otherwise "Fee"
beats "Fee Status" and "Status" becomes the value), and pushes both sides through
the field normaliser, keeping whichever validates.

**Merging.** Each field is voted across pages, weighted by the field manual's
evidence precedence (note > intake > biometric > sponsor > registry) plus a bonus
for a clean text layer over OCR. Case id comes from the per-page footer, which
survives in the text layer even on scans — not from the filename.

**Vocabulary snapping** with a similarity floor *and* a margin check: a reading
that is nearly equidistant between two vocabulary entries is rejected rather than
guessed, and a value that matches nothing passes through unchanged. That is what
should keep the gazetteer from silently corrupting unseen values on the private
test set.

## The adjudication policy

The public manual covers most of it; the rest I read off the training packets'
own adjudicator notes, which cite their reasons in plain text. That surfaced two
revoked sponsors beyond the manual's list (`SPN-2718`, `SPN-9090`) and the
embargoed home world `Wolf-1061c`.

Checking each condition against the labels shows the policy is close to
deterministic: disqualifying flag → denied (186/186), `TRANSIT-7` → denied
(53/53), unpaid fee → denied (50/50, including diplomatic packets — the manual's
waiver language does *not* rescue an unpaid fee), unknown fee → review (44/44).
Review-only flags are review 78% of the time and denial the rest.

Applying this order to *ground-truth* fields scores 70.4/80 with 89.2% accuracy —
so the policy is essentially at its ceiling and my remaining classification gap
is an extraction gap, not a policy gap. I searched all orderings of the
conditions; the ranking is insensitive to it because they rarely co-occur.

**The one non-obvious rule.** My first working version made 74 catastrophic false
approvals. Almost all were packets where I found no risk flag — because the
biometric slip was unreadable or absent, not because the applicant was clean. So
approval now requires having actually *read* flag evidence; "no flag found"
defaults to review. That cut false approvals to 14 at no cost in total score.
I checked whether it was merely a scoring artefact: among fully-native packets
with no biometric page at all, 30% still have a real risk flag in the labels. The
evidence genuinely isn't in the packet, so review is the honest answer.

## Confidence

Calibration is scored on Brier error against "was the decision right", so the
target is honesty, not a high number. The dominant predictor is *why* the
decision was made — a signed adjudicator note is right 99.3% of the time, an
unread risk panel 25.5%. A logistic model over the decision reason, OCR fraction,
unreadable-page fraction, evidence recovered, and cross-page agreement gives a
**5-fold cross-validated Brier of 0.123** (15.1/20) against 0.219 for the
best constant predictor. I report the cross-validated figure because the
in-sample 0.117 is optimistic.

## Failure modes I know about

- **Unreadable scans dominate the loss.** ~600 scanned pages still yield no
  usable classification. That is most of the 158 packets sent to review that
  should have been decided, and most of the missing `sponsor_id` (66%) and
  `arrival_date` (79%) values.
- **Sponsor IDs are the weakest field.** They are 4 random digits with no
  vocabulary to snap to, and some are deliberately smudged. Digit-confusion
  repair helps but cannot verify.
- **The gazetteer is a generalisation risk.** If the private test introduces new
  species or worlds, the threshold and margin check should pass them through
  unchanged rather than snap them — but they would then be raw OCR, and less
  accurate. This is the part of the system I'd most want to see private-test
  numbers for.
- **Revoked-sponsor and embargo lists are learned from ~10 note citations each.**
  They are right 72–87% of the time on training. A private test with a different
  revoked set would degrade these specific rules, though not the policy shape.
- **Multi-applicant packets** are detected (conflicting case ids in headers) and
  routed to review rather than resolved per-applicant.

## What I would do with another week

1. **Template-registered field OCR.** The forms have fixed layouts. Registering a
   detected page against a template and OCR'ing fixed field boxes — instead of
   discovering lines — would recover fields on pages too degraded to segment,
   which is exactly where I'm losing points.
2. **Train a small character classifier on the rendered fonts.** The generator
   uses a handful of fonts at known sizes; a few-hundred-KB CNN over segmented
   glyphs would likely beat Tesseract on this specific degradation, and fits the
   250 MiB artefact limit comfortably.
3. **Multi-hypothesis OCR with vocabulary-constrained decoding.** Keep Tesseract's
   top-N per line and score candidates against the closed vocabularies, rather
   than snapping a single noisy string after the fact.
4. **Per-field confidence, not just per-decision.** Extraction is scored per
   field; knowing which fields are shaky would let me choose between emitting a
   low-confidence reading and leaving it blank.
5. **Cross-validate the policy constants.** The revoked-sponsor and embargo lists
   are currently fitted on all 1,000 training packets with no held-out estimate
   of how much they generalise.

## Reproducing

`README.md` covers the Docker contract and the two fitted artefacts
(`mib/lexicon.json`, `mib/calibration.json`), both regenerated from the public
training split by scripts in `tools/`. Nothing is keyed to a case id or filename;
`python -m pytest tests/ -q` runs 20 unit tests covering layout parsing, OCR
normalisation, injection resistance and every policy branch.
